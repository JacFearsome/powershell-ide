## Powershell IDE built with Node.js
This is a web-based ide / terminal for PowerShell built with Node.js. As a result, if Powershell is installed on a Linux or macOS device, this app should work.

The app consists of two tabs, a terminal and a script pane. When you run the code in the script pane, the output appears in a modal pop-up.

In the script pane, press ctrl+space for autocomplete.

To try it out, clone the project:

`git clone https://github.com/JacFearsome/powershell-ide.git`

Install the node module dependencies:
	
`cd powershell-ide && npm install`

Run the app:

`node server.js`

And finally, go to http://localhost:7979/ in your web browser.
